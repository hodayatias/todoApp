## About this project

This project was completed as part of a guided course, where instructions and structure were provided by the instructor.  
While the code and implementation follow the course guidelines, it was a valuable learning experience that helped me understand key programming concepts and practical application.  
It demonstrates my ability to work through real coding tasks, troubleshoot issues, and apply newly acquired skills.
